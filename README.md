This is the repository for the DataCamp course Working with the OpenAI API. The
full course is available from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-openai-api).

Over recent years, OpenAI has emerged as a market leader in creating AI models,
such as GPT-4, and releasing them to the wider community in applications like
ChatGPT. These models can transform not only the way you work but also the
products and services that businesses provide to customers. To begin extracting
business value from OpenAI's models, you'll need to learn to work with their
Application Programming Interface, or API. In this course, you'll gain hands-on
experience working with the OpenAI API in Python, and will explore the wide
range of functionality that the API provides. By the end of the course, you'll
have the skills and knowledge needed to leverage the power of the OpenAI API to
develop solutions to real-world problems.
